# Bike-sharing-assignment
The bicycle sharing system is a service where bicycles are given to private individuals for short-term shared use for a fee or for free. 
Many bike-sharing systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock," which is usually computerized, where the user enters  payment information and the system unlocks it. 
This bike can then be returned to another dock in the same system.
